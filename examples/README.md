# Momento-Sequelize Read Aside Cache Client Examples

## Prerequisites

- Node version 14 or higher is required
- To use the examples, you will need a Momento API key. You can generate one using the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com/). 
The examples will utilize your API key via the environment variable `MOMENTO_API_KEY` you set.
- The examples use two caches `Users` and `UserGroups` that you will need to create in your Momento account. You can create 
them on the [console](https://console.gomomento.com/) as well!
    - As an alternative, you can pass a flag while instantiating our caching wrapper, which the examples already do
      to make it easy for you.

To run any of the examples you will need to install the dependencies once first:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Basic Example

This example demonstrates insert and select from Momento or your underlying database (on a cache Miss). 

```bash
# Run example code
MOMENTO_API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY> npm run basic
```

Example Code: [basic.ts](basic.ts)
